          practicing problem solver.{" "}

        <p>
         After years in quality control, sales, and customer service I found my passion in software.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          My tech journey began when I started watching SpaceX land their
          rockets on ocean barges. As a space and physics guy, I needed to know more.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned how the flight control software enables
          the rocket to be directed with grid fins towards a GPS target to land.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Intrigued, I bought an Arduino board to put on a drone and programmed it with basic Python code to fly between two waypoints and land. The drone executed my program and I became a passionate coder.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This opened my eyes to the unlimited potential use cases. I now am finishing my degree in Information Sceience & Tech with the Information Systems Development option at Penn State University.{" "}
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          Since enrollment, I have become proficient in several programming
          languages, developed 5 portfolio projects, utilized GitHub
          version control, and successfully integrated Amazon Web Services into some of my projects.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In the near future, my goals are: contribute to open-source projects,
          collaborate with other developers, and continue to improve my DSA skills through LeetCode and HackerRank.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding I enjoy fishing, free diving, and fighting for the
          health of coastal kelp beds around Southern California.
