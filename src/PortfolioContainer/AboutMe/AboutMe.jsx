    <p>Growing up I was a science nerd. If it included astronomy or spaceflight I was watching or 
      reading it. My dream was to be an astronaut but after high school, my eyesight was horrible and in 2004 all astronauts had to be pilots. </p>

      <p>Instead, I had jobs ranging from flooring salesman to aerospace quality control, to retail sales, 
        and rideshare driver. I was unhappy and looking for change. </p>
     
      <p>My programming journey started by watching SpaceX land their reusable Falcon 9 rockets on barges 
        in the ocean. Since rockets involve spaceflight, I needed to know more about 
        how these landings were even possible. </p>

        <p>I researched it and read about the rocket flight control software. It allowed them to be steered by grid fins
           and thus able to land. </p>

      <p>Intrigued, I bought an Arduino flight controller and wrote some basic code to command a drone to
         fly between two waypoints and land. That drone did exactly what I told it to and I was amazed. </p> 

   <p>I could see now that programming had unlimited potential. However, I knew how challenging the job market is in the tech industry, 
    so I began attending at Penn State University. </p>
    
    <p>In the years since enrollment, I have learnt several new languages and built a portfolio of projects, 
      much of which is in the projects section.</p>

   <p>In the future, I will be contributing to open-source projects, collaborating with others, and expanding my portfolio. </p>

      <p>Outside of coding I enjoy fishing, diving, and protesting for the health of our coastal kelp beds 
        around Southern California.
