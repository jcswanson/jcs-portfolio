        A recent graduate of Penn State University in Information Science and Technology,
        I embarked on a career transition from Quality Control in aerospace to the dynamic
        field of IT. With a passion for space sciences, satellites, and
        geography, my journey into the tech world was sparked by witnessing SpaceX's
        groundbreaking rocket landings in 2016. This groundbreaking event made me realize
        the potential of cheaper transportation on future remote sensing satellites and technologies{" "}

        Currently, I am working as an intern Project Manager for the USGS FGDC 
        GeoPathways program, where I oversee a team of 30+ interns
        participating in the Open Geospatial Consortium's 2023 Disaster Pilot Initiative. In this role
        I've worked closely with our sponsors ESRI, Amazon, Microsoft, Voyager Search and
